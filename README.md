# Tokenization:
Is a method to encrypt the payment method's sensitive information in order to avoid passing that kind of data in plain text during on each of the stages of the payment workflow.

# Authorization:
Refers to the stage in the payment workflow in which the customer confirms the payment through a specific payment method

# Capture:
The step of the payment workflow in which the merchant decides to cash in the sales tally, transfering the desired amount to his/her bank account

# Charge
Opposite to the 2-step flow (authorize-capture), charge process implies that once the customer authorizes the payment, it is immediately transferred to the merchants bank account

# Void
Is the cacellation of a transaction before it has been commited. For instance, if a customer backs off from a purchase, he or she can void the transaction before the amount its captured by the merchant

# Refund
Is the reversal of a transaction that has been charged to the customer. Since the payment amount gets directly transferred to the merchant's account, the amount requires to be refunded instead of voiding the transaction.
