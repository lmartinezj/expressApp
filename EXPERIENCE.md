1. I went on to create a paymentOS account as indicated by the instructions, It was a quite easy and intuitive step, but unfortunately, I did not know what purpose it was serving, since the idea was to create a PayU account.

2. Created the PayU account, equally intuitive, although there were some ID's that were rendering the experience confusing at a certain point in time

3. Next step was to create a provider, again, not entirely aware of the purpose of the operation, but the process is quite easy. At this point the concern is basically concentrated in the risk of configuring a setup that could end up being irreversible and therefore start all over again. I went on to create a PayU provider, but instead what should be recommended for testing purposes is creating a Mock provider

4. The business unit creation is equally intuitive and the processs at this moment becomes a lot more sensical given the fact that I was starting to understand the role of each of the entities previously configured

5. When it came to coding, which is not necessarily my strong point, I found the API documentation and samples quite easy to test, but when it came to coding an application that used the REST API, especially the secure fields form, it was not as fluid as I thought it could be, javascript is not a language that I am familiar with, I took the challenge and failed.

6. I was able to complete the generation of a token, and adding more fields to the checkout form, then I was certainly limited in knowledge and experience on how to handle requests and responses with JS based clients. Up to this moment I could console log the json responses for token generation and payment request, but I couldn't get the payment form to submit and action to a different page rendered by the Jade templating engine.
