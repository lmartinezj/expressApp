1. I went on to create a paymentOS account as indicated by the instructions, It was a quite easy and intuitive step, but unfortunately, I did not know what purpose it was serving, since the idea was to create a PayU account.

2. Created the PayU account, equally intuitive, although there were some ID's that were rendering the experience confusing at a certain point in time

3. Next step was to create a provider, again, not entirely aware of the purpose of the operation, but the process is quite easy. At this point the concern is basically concentrated in the risk of configuring a setup that could end up being irreversible and therefore start all over again. I went on to create a PayU provider, but instead what should be recommended for testing purposes is creating a Mock provider

4. The business unit creation is equally intuitive and the processs at this moment becomes a lot more sensical given the fact that I was starting to understand the role of each of the entities previously configured
